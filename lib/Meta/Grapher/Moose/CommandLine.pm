=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Meta::Grapher::Moose::CommandLine->run;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the module behind the F<graph-meta.pl> script. You probably want to go
read the documentation for that instead.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

This class accepts the following attributes:

=head2 renderer

The name of the renderer we should instantiate and pass to
L<Meta::Grapher::Moose> to render the graph with.

This will be converted to a class name by uppercasing the first character,
lowercasing all other characters and prepending
C<Meta::Grapher::Moose::Renderer::> to it.

Defaults to C<graphviz>.

=head1 METHODS

This class provides the following methods:

=head2 Meta::Grapher::Moose::CommandLine->run

Class method. Parses the command line options and creates a graph.
